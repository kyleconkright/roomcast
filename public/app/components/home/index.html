				<h3>How It Works</h3>
				<h2>Simple For Guests</h2>
				<p>One press of the RoomCast dial brings up RoomCast on the TV, where guests will discover a private personal area network. After joining they can open any cast-enabled app and tap the Cast button to display their favorite content on the big screen. Everything is controlled from the guest’s phone or tablet, using the mobile apps they already know and love. They can even keep using their phone for other things without disrupting what’s playing.</p>


				<h2>Simple For Hotels</h2>
				<p>RoomCast is an “over-the-top” streaming solution that works along with any existing in-room TV system. The solution works without head-end equipment; simply connect a RoomCast box to the TV and set the RoomCast dial on the nightstand. The RoomCast box connects to the TV (HDMI), to the Internet (Ethernet) and to power and then hides securely out of site. RoomCast includes an 802.11 wireless access point which is activated on demand, generating a unique WPA passcode. Chromecast is built into RoomCast and is preconfigured to be immediately discoverable upon joining the personal area network.</p>
