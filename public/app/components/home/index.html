		<div>
			<p>Your guests carry a world of content in the palm of their hands. On their mobile devices are apps like Netflix, YouTube, Pandora, Showtime, ESPN and so many more. What if there were an easy way for guests to stream that content to their in-room TV screen?</p>

			<p>TeleAdapt has developed RoomCast™ for exactly this purpose. RoomCast™ provides a wireless personal area network and an integrated Chromecast media streaming device.</p>

			<p>After joining the network, guests will discover the “cast button” within all of their cast-enabled apps.</p>
