				<h3>Installation</h3>
				<h2>A simple add-on</h2>
				<p>RoomCast is an “over-the-top” streaming solution that works along with any existing in-room TV or video system. The solution works without head-end equipment; simply connect a RoomCast box to the TV and set the RoomCast controller on the nightstand.  The RoomCast box connects to the TV (HDMI), to the Internet (Ethernet) and to power and then hides securely out of site. RoomCast includes an 802.11 wireless access point which is activated on demand, generating a unique WPA passcode. The Chromecast inside the RoomCast box is preconfigured and immediately discoverable upon joining the personal area network for simple plug and play installation.</p>
